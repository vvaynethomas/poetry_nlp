# poetry_project
 Analytics and Text Generation of Poetry Foundation Dataset


These are snippets and notebooks of things that the total platform may comprise.  At the drafting stage, I'm allowing a meandering to gain insights and see what's feasible in the timeframe set out.  Thus far, I have begun notebooks exploring the data visually, experimenting with embeddings and different backend methods for analyzing as well as generating text.  On the last working day, I found myself battling memory limitations while attempting to create padded line arrays for engagement via tensorflow's tokenizer as well as nltk's tokenizer.  In addition to the proposed parcels and snippets, I'm exploring methods of graph/network analysis with respect to semantics as well as structures/syntaxes for discourse analysis and information extraction alongside the exploratory node of building unique Literary Language Generators (LLGs) or other context/genre specific generators (comments perhaps, colloquial or aesthetically engaged chatbots?) via reinforcement against bot-detection algorithms, LitGAN?

Whatsoever happens in the short and long term, there is plenty of fertile ground for cultivation for a variety of uses, both artistic and commercial.
